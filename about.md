<p>I'm full-time dreamer and part-time lazy software engineer. I have interest in software development, data analysis, and writing.  As human, i never stop learning and love challenges.</p>

<p>I've started learn programming in 2015 due to join the Tech Community named BugisDev, even thought i've started study at Education of Informatics and Computer Engineering  in 2014. in BugisDev, i learn basic programming, how to create simple program with a good algorithm, object - oriented programming, and build MVC project.  2 years later in early 2018 i started working at Valutac as remote backend developer.</p>
